# Capsone-Build-Your-Gym-Ecommerce
I created an ecommerce website where users can register an account and purchase gym products. The backend was created in the Spring Boot framework written in Java, whereas the front end was created in the React framework written in JavaScript.

# Home Page
Here is the homepage of Build Your Gym. It features a list of items separated into categories the user can view and add to their cart.

# Register Page
Users can register an account that will be stored in the MySQL database. The user's ID and information will then be saved on their web browser through a JSON Web Token.

# Checkout Page
Here is the Checkout Page. After a user adds gym equipment to their cart, they can view their items. They can select a quantity for each product, which will calculate the new quantity with the original price of the selected product, and a new total amount will be generated.
